## Housekeeping

1. Lab is inside today. We'll analyze our data and start thinking about the poster project.


## Learning objectives

* Tidy, wrangle, and analyze hydrologic data for hypothesis testing.
* Articulate how you will analyze your data to address your hypotheses.


## Resources

* [Data organization in spreadsheets slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ZN_ijD-HA0sWme2a1BvdeH27_FyqzHToK-fItbCxli8/edit?usp=drive_link)

## Lesson plan

1. Take quiz 10

2. How to use [Google My Maps](https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/) to make a study site map

2. Work with your groups to tidy and wrangle your data. Use the methods I went over last time as a guide (see [data tidying instructions](https://mrne392.github.io/lesson-plans/24-hydro-data-analysis.html)).
