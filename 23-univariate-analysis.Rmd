## Housekeeping

* Quiz next Thursday: Be able to articulate your hydrologic field study data analysis methods and how they will enable you to test your hypotheses
* Lab today: meet in SH 112, then retrieve loggers. Be prepared to go outside in whatever conditions your loggers are deployed in.
* Another EC opportunity: Saturday, November 9 from 1 pm to 4 pm spat counting with SMRWA. Please let Emma Green know if you can make it via email (emmasmrwa@gmail.com) or signing up via the [sign-up genius](https://www.signupgenius.com/go/10C0944A5AC2FA5F9C16-52918137-counting)

## Lesson plan

1. Quiz
1. Sign up for poster groups in [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BgDhoONcbGGGXkjJAlRhcocOCIhK9FUYvEODWMZDmXY/edit?usp=sharing). You don't need to have a title yet but it would be good to start thinking about which project you want to use.
1. *Chasing Coral*: I was going to cover some other ancillary data stuff, but today feels like a good time to instead take a step back and think about why studying marine science is important and why we need people who can do robust field-based marine science research.
